# House Prices

This sub-repository stores my learning process of Supervised Machine Learning during the **#30_hours** program of **[Baot](https://extend-tech.com/baot)**, Israel's largest community of senior female engineers and computer scientists.

Using Kaggle's [House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview), I created a model that can predict house prices.
During this learning process I learned about ML, what it means to train a supervised model, from investigating the data to preprocessing it and testing that the model is accurate enough, avoiding false positives and data leakage.

## Getting Started

You can read about each step in [a blogpost I wrote to summarize what I'd learned](https://medium.com/@miryeh/create-a-supervised-model-in-30-hours-or-less-a0eb0ace0900).
